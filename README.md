Second coming of the unpopular Apptranslator Version 1!

## Why?

There is no decent lightweight client-side translation library made for hybrid mobile applications for example. [i18next](http://i18next.com/) exists, but it is overkill for simple applications.

## What?

- Simple and fast application translation
- Translations are stored as a JSON file
- Translated element caching makes re-translating quite fast
- Get translation by translation id
- Reverse-lookup translations by text
- Data-attribute based translation id system (means clean HTML and makes runtime attribute modifications possible)
- No heavy, extra localization features - only pure text translations

As of 18.8.2015 GaleJS is jQuery free!
